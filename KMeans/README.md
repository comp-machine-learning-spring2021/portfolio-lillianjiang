# KMeans: Finding Different types of Exoplanets
In this coding element, I will practice unsupervised learning algorithm `KMeans` to perform grouping task.  

This coding element consists of an “instructive” jupyter notebook `KMeans_Transit.ipynb` that walks through the code with plain text explaining in lay terms the process, and two unit test files `kmeans.py` and `test_kmeans.py`. 

## Motivation 
I am interested in finding the clusters for exoplanets to see if there are some common types of exoplanets out there in the universe.

## Dataset
The data is from the NASA Exoplanet Archive: https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html. I extract the exoplanets that are found by Transit Method into `../Data/confirm_transit.csv`. 

## Key Result
See ![detailed discussion](https://github.com/comp-machine-learning-spring2021/portfolio-lillianjiang/blob/main/KMeans/result1.png) in Jupiter Notebook.
