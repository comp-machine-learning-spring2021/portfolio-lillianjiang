# Final Portfolio

## About me
Hello World, My name is Lillian. I am currently a junior student at Smith College, majoring in computer science and astronomy. My research interests are exoplanets, computational simulations, and machine learning.

After taking CSC294 Computational Machine Learning, I am familar with unsupervised and supervised learning algorithm for both classification and prediction tasks at a computational level. I am an advanced-level programmer in Python.

I would like to apply machine learning onto my astronomy research, helping me to build up data analysis on exoplanet exploration. Besides research, I am a visual designer in music industry, and I can speak four languages.

## Motivation for the Project
I am a member of the Exoplanet Team at Smith College under the supervision of Professor James Lowenthal. We use Smith Collegeâ€™s 16-inch Meade LX200 ACF Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope to detect transiting exoplanets. I am interested to probe around the current dataset of transiting exoplanets and study the overall model for them. I will use the same [exoplanets dataset](https://github.com/comp-machine-learning-spring2021/portfolio-lillianjiang/blob/main/data/confirmed_transit.csv) to perform three machine learnign tasks using different algorithm.

- [Regression: Mass Period relationship](https://github.com/comp-machine-learning-spring2021/portfolio-lillianjiang/tree/main/Mass-Radius)
- [Make Predictions for Missing Orbit Semi-Major Axis](https://github.com/comp-machine-learning-spring2021/portfolio-lillianjiang/tree/main/Prediction)

## Dataset
The exoplanet dataset is extracted from the NASA Exoplanet Archive: http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu
