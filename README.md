# Final Portfolio Draft

## About me
Hello World, My name is Lillian. I am currently a junior student at Smith College, majoring in computer science and astronomy. My research interests are exoplanets, computational simulations, and machine learning.

I am familar with unsupervised and supervised learning algorithm??

- The skills and expertise you have in machine learning
- The depth of your knowledge in the field
- Your interests beyond machine learning
    - I would like to apply machine learning onto my astronomy research, helping me to build up data analysis on exoplanet exploration. Besides research, I am a visual designer in music industry, and I can speak four languages.

## Motivation 
I am a member of the Exoplanet Team at Smith College under the supervision of Professor James Lowenthal. We use Smith Collegeâ€™s 16-inch Meade LX200 ACF Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope to detect transiting exoplanets. I am interested to probe around the current dataset of transiting exoplanets and study the overall model for them. I will use the same [exoplanets dataset](https://github.com/comp-machine-learning-spring2021/portfolio-lillianjiang/blob/main/data/confirmed_transit.csv) to perform four different task using different algorithm.


## Three significant coding elements:
- One full piece on supervised learning and one full piece on unsupervised learning
    - k-means from HW2; comparsion of my implementation and sklearn
    - 
- At least one revised assignment from this course (either a project or a homework) 
    - maybe expand on project2
- Something entirely new
    - i can try apply ml to astronomy dataset 


## Plan

## Dataset
The exoplanet dataset is extracted from the NASA Exoplanet Archive: http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu

## TODO
1. data exploration
2. supervised learning - linear regression [radius and mass]
