# Final Portfolio Draft

## About me
Hello World, My name is Lillian. I am currently a junior student at Smith College, majoring in computer science and astronomy. My research interests are exoplanets, computational simulations, and machine learning.

I am familar with unsupervised and supervised learning algorithm??

- The skills and expertise you have in machine learning
- The depth of your knowledge in the field
- Your interests beyond machine learning
    - I would like to apply machine learning onto my astronomy research, helping me to build up data analysis on exoplanet exploration. Besides research, I am a visual designer in music industry, and I can speak four languages.

## Three significant coding elements:
- One full piece on supervised learning and one full piece on unsupervised learning
    - k-means from HW2; comparsion of my implementation and sklearn
    - 
- At least one revised assignment from this course (either a project or a homework) 
    - maybe expand on project2
- Something entirely new
    - i can try apply ml to astronomy dataset 


## Plan
Use the same exoplanets dataset to perform four different task using different algorithm.
## Dataset
The exoplanet dataset is extracted from the NASA Exoplanet Archive  http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu

## TODO
1. data exploration
2. supervised learning - linear regression [radius and mass]
